In this assignment, I have to implement a REST API that allow a user to perform CRUD operation on the student records.
In more details:
01.Assignment should be done without any framework like express etc.
02.Student-master record is given in student.json.
03.Also given set of the files which contains records for each subject, say sub_1.json, sub_2.json and
   so on.
04.I need to implement REST API to perform CRUD operations on the student records.
05.Test all the APIs using the CURL command line tool and Google REST Client.

CRUD operations:
01.CREATE operation should accept student informantion as input and modify the student.json and
   sub_x.json files.
02.READ operation should accept the student id and return the detail information of that student.
03.READ/LIST operation will returns information of all students.
04.UPDATE operation should update present record.
05.DELETE operation will delete present record.
